1. SampleSource interface ✔
2. SampleBuffer class (basic)
 - Should take a work function and SampleSource for input
 - Produces work(samples)
3. Convert InputSource to SampleSource interface ✔
4. Test current IQ waveform with SampleSource interface
5. Test with dummy SampleBuffer class (just 1:1 work function)
6. GNURadio memory source/sink blocks
7. Create some SampleBuffer classes that run a flowgraph
8. More test
9. Multiple waveforms
#. Pretty things up:
 - Rubber band to select samples
 - Catch all appropriate repaint events
 - Labels & legends for waveforms
 - Menu options to add/remove waveforms
